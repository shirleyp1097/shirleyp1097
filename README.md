Hello, my name is Paris Shirley. I'm a software developer from San Antonio, Texas. I graduated from the University of Notre Dame.


ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building a card game web application.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to implement APIs in a Spring Boot application.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything that will help me become a better software developer.

ðŸ“« You can reach me at shirleyp1097@gmail.com or on my LinkedIn(https://www.linkedin.com/in/paris-shirley/).

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my journey to becoming a software developer.

âš¡ Fun fact: Nikola Jokic is the best basketball player in the world.
